# Data_Analysis_Project

## Prepare   
### Guiding questions   
● Where is your data located?   
The data is located at a [database](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) provided by Divvy  
● How is the data organized?  
The data is organized sequentially by date order    
● Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC(reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited)?  
I am assuming there are no credibility or bias issues with the data, due to it being directly recommneded by Google. The data seems reliable due to it's organized internal structure, original due to the actual existance of the company Divvy, comprehensive due to it's neat and understandable internal structure, current due to the data being ordered sequentially from years 2004-2020, it is not cited because it's internal rather than external data   
● How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility
● How did you verify the data’s integrity?
● How does it help you answer your question?
● Are there any problems with the data?
